This is a work day scheduler to track the users time and plans. The time-blocks change color according to the current time using moment.js. The save button will allow the user to enter data and have it stored for future reference. Most people completed this task using JQuery. I wanted to work on getting a better understanding of vanilla JavaScript so I decided to complete the assignment using what I have learned in class.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
